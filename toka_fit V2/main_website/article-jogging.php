                <h1>Why Jogging is Good for You</h1>
                <p>Yes, you might have run a mile in high school. But if you don&rsquo;t run regularly these days, you might not realize all the benefits of running. So, we&rsquo;re here to give you a reminder of all the advantages you&rsquo;ll gain from a consistent run routine.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Research proves that regular exercise, at least 150 minutes per week, which is about 30 minutes, five times a week, according to the Department of Health and Human Services&mdash;and running in particular&mdash;has major disease-fighting benefits. Studies have shown that exercise like running can help prevent obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, some cancers, and a host of other conditions. What&rsquo;s more, scientists have shown that running also vastly improves the quality of your emotional and mental health.</p>

                <p> Since the pandemic, even more people have been reaping the benefits of running. World Athletics and Nielsen Sports partnered up to survey more than 5,000 runners in 10 different countries and discovered 13 percent of those runners said they began running in the last year. Of that 13 percent, 9 percent say they&rsquo;re new to running and picked up the habit in pandemic times. And 20 percent of all runners surveyed say they will continue to run more often once the pandemic is over&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a good thing considering how much running can improve your life and health.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Here, all the specific benefits you&rsquo;ll gain from running, backed by research:</p>
