                <h1>James Douglas</h1>
                <p>Life is about challenging yourself and learning every day how to be better than the day before.</p>
                
                <br>

                <p>I became a Personal Trainer to help others grow into the best version of themselves physically and emotionally. Training to me is about how to push yourself to new levels, whether it be in the gym or in your day to day life.</p>

                <br>

                <p>When you decide to work with me I will:</p>

                <br>

                <p>Challenge you</p>

                <br>

                <p>Change you</p>

                <br>

                <p>Get you results</p>

                <br>

                <p>Health is more than the physical appearance of the body. We have to take into account how emotional health can affect us as well, and this is why I aim to help you discover a new approach to your health, and not only achieve your goals but unlock new areas of health.</p>

                <br>

                <p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s your first time in the gym, just need some guidance, have set goals to achieve or just want to be a better version of yourself; I offer services that are personal to your goals.</p>

                <br>
