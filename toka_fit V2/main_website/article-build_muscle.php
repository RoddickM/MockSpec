                <h1>How to Build More Muscles</h1>
                <p>When it comes to physique improvements, muscle building is often a top priority.</p>

                <p>Added muscle mass will increase the definition of your muscles, improve your lean body mass, and add bulk and size to your frame in all the right places.</p>

                <p>Muscle growth takes time, persistence, and a long-term commitment to the process.</p>

                <br>

                <p>While gaining large amounts of muscle may seem daunting, with proper training programs and adequate consumption of certain foods, serious muscle building is possible for most people.</p>

                <br>

                <p>This article breaks down everything you need to know when it comes to building muscle, including how to work out, what to eat, and recovery protocols.</p>

                <br>

                <h2>The basics of building muscle</h2>
                <p> Anatomically, skeletal muscles are a series of parallel cylindrical fibers that contract to produce force. This muscle contraction allows all external human movement to occur.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Your body is in a constant process of renewing and recycling the amino acids, or protein building blocks, in your muscles.</p>

                <p>If your body removes more protein than it adds, you&rsquo;ll lose muscle mass. If the net protein synthesis is even, no measurable change in muscle size occurs. Finally, if your body deposits more protein than it removes, your muscles will grow.</p>

                <br>

                <p>The key to building muscle is to increase the rate of protein deposition while minimizing the rate of protein breakdown.</p>

                <p>This process of increasing your muscle mass is known as muscle hypertrophy, and it&rsquo;s a primary goal of resistance training.</p>

                <p>The muscle building process is driven by several factors, including hormones like testosterone and growth hormone, as well as the availability of amino acids and other nutrients.</p>

                <br>

                <p>To build new muscle tissue, your primary tools for increasing your body&rsquo;s rate of protein synthesis are performing resistance training and getting sufficient amounts of protein and overall nutrients.</p>

                <br>

                <p>The correct amount of resistance training drives your body&rsquo;s hormonal response toward building muscle, but it requires sufficient protein and energy availability to ensure the process results in muscle gains as opposed to muscle losses (1Trusted Source).</p>

                <br>

                <p>While researchers and experts continue to study the science of optimizing muscle gains, performing resistance training using moderate to heavy loads, combined with relatively high protein intake, remains the only tried-and-true training method for increasing muscle mass (2Trusted Source).</p>

                <br>

                <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
                <p>Building muscle requires your body to deposit more protein molecules into your muscles than it removes. Resistance training with weights and ensuring proper nutrition are the primary means for accomplishing this goal.</p>
