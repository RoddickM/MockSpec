                <h1>Don Joe</h1>
                <p>Having done karate since the age of five, I have been brought up with a transferable discipline which I have been able to implement into all areas of my life. I not only have a passion for fitness and helping people but also for bettering myself physically and mentally each and every day.</p>

                <br>

                <p>I have had a wide range of experience in the fitness industry and have dabbled with all sorts of different disciplines, from to bodybuilding to powerlifting, from yoga to calisthenics/gymnastics, from Karate to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and almost everything in-between.</p>
                
                <br>

                <p>I have battled with adversity, having depression since the age of 18 after being diagnosed with type one diabetes, so I have the knowledge and experience first hand to know what its like to train through having what seems like a physical or mental barrier.</p>
                
                <br>

                <p>Being strong is the solution to all your problems/goals, from mental to physical. If you&rsquo;re currently looking to become more confident and happy, improve how you look or looking to grow old gracefully and stay mobile for as long as possible.</p>
                
                <br>

                <p>All my programmes are tailored specifically for individual clients as I know that not everybody is the same.</p>
                
                <br>

                <p>If you have any questions on how I run my business and how I can change your life for the better, feel free to contact me via email or text. Or alternatively, come and find me out and about on the gym floor!</p>
